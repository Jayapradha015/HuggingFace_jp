32,Tasneem.S,Very Disappointed,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The RGB lights and shape of the box is great and that's about it. The build quality ain't good since it is plastic so need to handle it carefully or it will break. Coming to the earbuds, they just don't fit right and the touch sensitivity is frustrating. I've changed the earbuds size to small and they still fall out. The sound quality is the worst... I have to set the volume at 80+ to hear anything properly so that's a bummer. Beast mode kicks in randomly when I'm trying to adjust the ear buds... Overall, I am very upset and disappointed that I bought these. Am I keeping them? Yes, have no choice since the amazon packaging and everything else has been thrown away by a very helpful ""helper"". This was a bad purchase and waste of good money."

¬†This review is being written after two weeks of purchase and use1. Looks  awesome, the led lights on the outer edge gives stylish look. It blinks when you open the case.2. Ear plugs are decent, fits ok in your ears, won't fall off like many others.3. Call quality is ok , couldn't experience any effective noise cancellation.4. Bass is average, sound quality fairly ok.5. Battery life - works for 7 hours if used heavily.Cons1. Range - Not capable enough to penetrate thick walls , in case of line of sight it's working fine within the range of 20 feet, in case of walls as mentioned above, it disconnects automatically.2. Touch controls are really a nightmare, you would know what kind of tap will do what.3. Manufacturing quality - cheap plasticOverall it's a good buy within this price range.After one month1. Don't buy this cheap product.2. Pl don't go by the looks of it .3. Left bud dosent even last for 12 mins even though you charge it fully.4. Within 5 feet the Bluetooth gets disconnected.5. Stange noise and induction noise in the background while taking calls.6. Now i am charging it more than i am using it.Don't buy , Horrible experience"

131,Tasneem.S,Very Disappointed,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The RGB lights and shape of the box is great and that's about it. The build quality ain't good since it is plastic so need to handle it carefully or it will break. Coming to the earbuds, they just don't fit right and the touch sensitivity is frustrating. I've changed the earbuds size to small and they still fall out. The sound quality is the worst... I have to set the volume at 80+ to hear anything properly so that's a bummer. Beast mode kicks in randomly when I'm trying to adjust the ear buds... Overall, I am very upset and disappointed that I bought these. Am I keeping them? Yes, have no choice since the amazon packaging and everything else has been thrown away by a very helpful ""helper"". This was a bad purchase and waste of good money."

¬†Lie is been told about 40 ms latency it is more the 60-70 ms latency rest design is good and also mic they say it's good whereas it has the shitiest mic as the other end the voice goes very low. I have used other products but this is the worst of all.If any gamer planning to buy please dont buy as specially in pubg his character will die and then he will hear the gun shots."
